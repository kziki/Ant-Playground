# Ant Playground
langton's ant / turmite simulation made in godot.

currently runs on gdscript at ~1.6 million ticks per second.

will eventually port over to csharp which would be a lot faster !!

you can play with the web version [here](https://ant-playground.kziki.xyz/) or download the releases. the executable runs a bit faster so i would recommend that one.
